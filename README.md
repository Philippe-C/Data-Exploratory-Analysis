# Data-Exploratory-Analysis
Hello,

This is the assignment corresponding to the first week in the Exploratory Data Analysis course from Coursera!

The "Load_data.R" file presents the code to read the data contained in the file "household_power_consumption.txt"

The "Plot1.R", "Plot2.R", and "Plot3.R" files use these data to build the requested plots ("Plot1.png", "Plot2.png" and "Plot3.png").

In order to use a slightly different method to access the data, "Plot4.R" present another way of coding the access and the subsetting of the data and allows to create the last requested plot (the 4 subplots saved in "Plot4.png")

Here are the final results and you can compare easily:
