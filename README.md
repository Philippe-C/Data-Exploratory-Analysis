# Data-Exploratory-Analysis
Hello,

This is the assignment corresponding to the first week in the Exploratory Data Analysis course from Coursera!

The "Load_data.R" file presents the code to read the data contained in the file "household_power_consumption.txt"

The "Plot1.R", "Plot2.R", and "Plot3.R" files use these data to build the requested plots ("Plot1.png", "Plot2.png" and "Plot3.png").

In order to use a slightly different method to access the data, "Plot4.R" present another way of coding the access and the subsetting of the data and allows to create the last requested plot (the 4 subplots saved in "Plot4.png")

Here are the final results and you can compare easily:

### Plot 1

### Plot 2
![plot2](https://github.com/Philippe-C/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot2.png?raw=true)
### Plot 3
![plot3](https://github.com/Philippe-C/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot3.png?raw=true)
### Plot 4
![plot4](https://github.com/Philippe-C/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot4.png?raw=true)

Have fun!
